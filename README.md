My attempts at Advent of Code
- 2025 will be written in Dart again and hopefully I will reach at least day 19
- [2024](https://github.com/fsasm/aoc2024) written in Dart and made it to day 15
- [2023](https://github.com/fsasm/aoc2023) also written in Go and got to day 9
- [2022](https://github.com/fsasm/aoc2022) written in Go and only reached day 3

For 2026 I'm planning to learn and practice Lua, OCaml or Zig.
